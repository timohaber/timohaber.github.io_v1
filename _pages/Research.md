# ”Non-linearities, sticky prices and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy 
with Guido Ascari, 2021. Conditionally accepted at The Economic Journal  

A sticky price theory of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy shocks
based on state-dependent pricing yields two testable implications, that do not
hold in time-dependent models. First, large monetary policy shocks should
yield proportionally larger initial responses of the price level. Second, in a
high trend infation regime, the response of the price level to monetary policy
shocks should be larger and real effects smaller. Our analysis provides evidence
supporting these non-linear effects in the response of the price level in aggregate US data, indicating state-dependent pricing as an important feature of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.
