Thank you for visiting my website.  

I am a PhD student at the [Faculty of Economics](https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Elisa Faraglia](https://sites.google.com/site/elisafaragliapage/).  
My research interests lie at the intersection of monetary economics, heterogeneous agent models and financial frictions.

Before joining Cambridge, I completed the [MPhil in Economics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mphil-economics) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and the [BSc in Economics and Politics](https://www.bath.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate-2021/economics/bsc-economics-and-politics/) at the [Unviversity of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).
