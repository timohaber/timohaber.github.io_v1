<a href="https://timohaber.github.io/assets/pdf/E200.pdf"> Solow Growth, Consumption and Investment </a> | 2018-2021 

</summary>
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major questions and theories in neoclassical economics. The goal is to develop the “tools and tastes” necessary to understand the main models of economic growth and business cycle. First, it discusses the Solow-Swan model with exogenous technological progress and savings decision. We analyse the equilibrium of the model and the comparative dynamics around the steady state. Second, we study the microfoundation of consumption and then we study the business cycles phenomena and set up a simple model, which can generate some business cycle facts. Finally we look deeper into investment theory.
